# Multilinear_Regression_for_GII

In my study, I will perform multilinear regression using 5 feature variables to predict 1 target variable. 
The dataset I am using is [Gender Inequality Index](https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2021-22_HDR/HDR21-22_Statistical_Annex_GII_Table.xlsx) obtained from Human Development Reports from United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The dataset has 2021 data on different parameters including Gender Inequality Index (GII) for countries around the world. The fields in the dataset with brief explanation are as follows:

- Country: Country name
- Gender Inequality Index Value for each country
- Raking of GII of each country
- Maternal mortality ratio (deaths per 100,000 live births) which is 2017 data.
- Adolescent birth rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15â€“19)
- Share of seats in parliament (% held by women)
- Population with at least some secondary education (% ages 25 and older). For both Male and Female
- Labor force participation rate: (% ages 15 and older). For both male and Female.
